title: About
---

Dan Carpenter is an ecologist and environmental data scientist.  I am interested in using environmental data to support evidence-based decision making.  I think good data are the foundations of good decisions and much of my work is about turning good data into evidence to support those decisions.

I have a BSc (Hons.) in Wildlife Conservation (University of East London) and a PhD in Soil Science (University of Reading).  I have worked in academic research, local government and the NGO sector.  I am a Chartered Environmentalist (CEnv).  For more on my background, please see my [CV](/cv/).

R is my main tool for environmental data science. I have so far written one package and I am working on a couple of others.  I also use QGIS for a lot of my work.  I am very much a beginner and this website will document both my successes and my failures in creating work that is, I hope, of value to others.  This website will showcase some of the [projects](/projects/) I am working on, as well as being a platform for articles about my work, both professional and otherwise.

I currently work at the [Thames Valley Environmental Records Centre](http://www.tverc.org) where I put into practice the business of using data for decision making.

I drink a LOT of tea.  I love cricket.
