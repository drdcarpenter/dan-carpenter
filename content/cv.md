Professional History

Thames Valley Environmental Records Centre, Oxford

March 2016 – present

Projects Manager 

I am the scientific and technical lead for the records centre, ensuring that all our work is based on the most appropriate and up-to-date science and technology to deliver services to customers.

I develop and deliver a range of mapping and data analysis projects for a variety of customers, including local authorities and conservation NGOs, using GIS (MapInfo, ArcGIS, QGIS) and data science (R) approaches.  These include a service to identify and map green corridors for neighbourhood plans, habitat connectivity mapping and a bat habitat suitability model.

I have developed a range of biodiversity net gain services for TVERC.  This includes a local derived metric based on the first DEFRA metric, a service to provide calculations to developers, consultants and local authorities.  I have also delivered biodiversity net gain training to local authorities and consultancy.  I have also developed biodiversity net gain data standards and survey and monitoring standards for West Oxfordshire District Council and Trust for Oxfordshire’s Environment (TOE) in delivering biodiversity net gain.  I am also working with the Association of Local Environmental Record Centres (ALERC) to further develop standards for biodiversity net gain.  

I also delivered a talk to the Association of Local Government Ecologists (ALGE) on biodiversity net gain at their December 2019 conference.

I am responsible for line managing four staff who carry out field surveys, project work and manage TVERC’s volunteer programme four within a framework of regular meetings where performance is assessed

I consulted with several researchers in natural capital and ecosystem services to produce a method for carrying out a natural capital assessment for Oxfordshire, culminating in natural capital and ecosystem services being specifically referenced in the Oxfordshire 2050 plan scoping document.

I have promoted the work of TVERC and Local Environmental Records Centres by giving conference presentations.  I delivered a presentation at the Enterprise Applications of the R Language (EARL) conference in London in September 2017.  I outlined details of a bat alert model I have been developing to assist local planning authorities in determining which householder applications require bat surveys.  I gave a presentation at the UK-India Agricultural Ecology Initiative meeting in London in September 2017.  I outlined the work that Local Environmental Records Centres do and how we use data to help others make sustainable decisions about land management.
  

Parks & Countryside Service, Bracknell Forest Council, Bracknell

March 2013 – March 2016

Biodiversity Officer

I was responsible for delivering high quality biodiversity advice to the planning department, for both development management and planning policy.  I delivered land management advice and carried out species and habitat surveys to the Council’s Parks & Countryside Service and I coordinated the delivery of the local Biodiversity Action Plan.

I project-managed the enhancement of green spaces owned by the Council to meet Natural England’s standards for Suitable Alternative Natural Green Spaces with a budget of over £100,000 annually.  This required the specification, procurement, contracting and supervising of projects to enhance green spaces, including path installation and upgrade, habitat works and interpretation signs.

I drafted the Council’s first tree strategy, a document which set out the Council’s approach to protecting and managing trees, woodlands and hedgerows.  I also led the development of a strategy for the sustainable management of the Council’s woodland estate, which includes plans to derive income from timber and woodfuel.  In developing the strategy, I consulted with people and organisations from across the woodfuel sector on potential approaches to support the sustainable management of Council woodland.  This approach resulted in significant investment from the Council to achieve these aims.

Soil Biodiversity Group, Life Sciences Department, Natural History Museum, London

July 2009 – January 2013, 

Post-doctoral Research Assistant managing a landscape scale biodiversity survey of the New Forest and Sabah, Malaysia. Duties include: survey design and planning; budget management; organising and carrying out fieldwork, including health and safety; species identification; managing a team of volunteers in the field and lab; data analysis; report writing and public engagement activities.

Centre for Agri-Environment Research, University of Reading 

March 2009 – June 2009, 

Research Assistant on a project called SOILSERVICE looking at the impacts of land use and climate change on soil ecosystem services.  Duties include experiment design, construction and implementation, soil sampling and sample sorting.

Burnham Beeches NNR, Corporation of London

December 2008 – February 2009, 

Researcher investigating the effect of wood ants on other invertebrates.  I wrote a literature review of interactions between wood ants and other woodland invertebrates.

Education

PhD Soil Science, University of Reading / Natural History Museum, London 

October 2004 – December 2008, 

Thesis title: The role of earthworms in the chemical and physical weathering of soil minerals.  I developed my skills in experimental design, data analysis, report writing and in communicating my science.

I established the first evidence that earthworms accelerate soil mineral weathering in a series of laboratory experiments.  I combined several techniques to achieve this including X-ray Diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy.  I developed my skills in experimental design, data analysis and in communicating my science.  I developed my skills in experimental design, data analysis, report writing and in communicating my science. 

I gave a plenary talk at the International Earthworm Ecology Symposium in Krakow, Poland, in September 2005.  I was interviewed by the BBC World Service as part of a programme about soils entitled ‘From the Ground Up’ in which I talked about earthworm ecology and diversity in 2006.  I acquired funding from the British Society of Soil Science to organise the first meeting of UK earthworm scientists which was held at the Natural History Museum, London in September 2007.

BSc (Hons.) Wildlife Conservation, University of East London, awarded 2.1

September 2000 – June 2004, 

Dissertation title: The effect of vegetation heterogeneity on the diversity of soil and leaf litter invertebrates in the UK.  I gained a solid foundation in ecology and conservation, including the political and legal aspects of conservation.  The course placed a great emphasis on species identification and I gained skills in plant, invertebrate and bird identification. I also gained skills and experience in a variety of sampling techniques in terrestrial, freshwater and marine habitats and GIS systems.
